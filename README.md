# Repo Ops
---
## Description
A small system that, given a GitHub repo URL, reads the repo, indexes its files for search, then uses GPT-5 with retrieval (RAG) to: 
* Explain how to run it locally, 
* Show how to test it, 
* Propose how to deploy it, 
* Summarize what it does and its tech stack, 
* And answers relevant questions about the repo with citations to exact file/lines.
